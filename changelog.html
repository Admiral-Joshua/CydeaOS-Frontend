		---------------  CydeaOS  ---  Change Log  ---  v1.0.1  ---------------
		
 - Updated the refresh rate of the music tracks on the server. This should *hopefully* reduce the chances of
 complete silence client-side. An odd issue some players were experiencing.
 
 - Server-wiped. With very little activity and a lot of random accounts created, we've thought it best to clean
 things up a bit, and so most players will need to create a new account to continue playing the game.
 
 - Added AUTOCOMPLETE to the Terminal (AT LONG LAST!!) That took some time, and it's not perfect, but it's getting
 there!
 
 - Fixed an issue that rendered the GRAVE key ` impossible for showing / hiding the terminal. The terminal should
 be open/showable again now without needing to pop open your browser's console! xD
 
 - Few other minor server bug-fixes, and beginning infrastructure laid out for soon available Team Deathmatch gamemode.

	    ---------------  CydeaOS  ---  Change Log  ---  v1.0.0  ---------------
		
 - FileViewer / Text Editor was finally added to the game, meaning the contents of files can now be read.
 
 - Added the FileViewer's open ability to be accessible via either clicking elements in the file browser, 
    or by typing "cat" followed by the file name in the terminal.
	
 - Fixed a Music Bug where music would only switch to Dramatic genre once during a hacking sequence, and never
   again.
   
 - Fixed a Text Editor bug where player's weren't able to save their changes to a text file in-game.

	    ---------------  CydeaOS  ---  Change Log  ---  v0.9.7b  ---------------
	
--------  What's Changed?  --------	

 - Fixed a bug that occurred last night on the server-side code, causing the server to crash when choosing
   node-specific IP generation on the Host Game screen.
   
 - Rewritten "Garbage Collection" algorithm - hopefully solving issues with in-game changes effecting other games.

	    ---------------  CydeaOS  ---  Change Log  ---  v0.9.6b  ---------------

--------  What's Changed?  --------	
 - Rewritten eng-game protocals on Server-side, should fix crashing / hanging issues when the game timer reaches zero.
 
 - Made version information server-side as it makes my job a LOT easier updating the information as required.

 - Repaired in-game computer IP generation on the server-side, to fix the 'Node Specific' IPs option creating multiple
   computers with the IP address #RANDOMIP4# or something similar.
   
 - Identified and fixed issue where users couldn't log in if more than one account was present on the Home Page.
 
---------  What's New?  ---------
 - Added new Settings Menu to the Main Menu, allowing for Music and Sound Effect volumes to be changed.
  <del>account Settings will also be ultimately managed here, once I've got all of that working it will be available.</del>
   
 - FINALLY Fixed the Redirect issue we were having with the Icon Setting Page after just creating a new account
   This should automatically redirect you back to the home page now, notifying you that the update was successful!
   
 - Account Settings successfully styled and added to the settings menu! - Adding Changing of Username/Password/Email
   address on your account.

	    ---------------  CydeaOS  ---  Change Log  ---  v0.9.5b  ---------------

-----  What's Changed?  -----
 - Added in a few lines to the server, to protect from the same user being added multiple times!
   - This SHOULD be fixed now

 - Cleaned up and removed some unnecessary functions, should at least free up a little bit of client-side RAM.

 - Added a secondary check so that the RETURN key does not start taking input into the terminal.
   All other keys than ENTER and '`' will however redirect further terminal input to the terminal.

 - Gave the Terminal and FileBrowser just enough TLC so that Hiding/Closing Commands & buttons
   *should* now work first time.

 - Repaired some stuff related to the `pwordcrack` program. This should now get you ADMIN access on all comps
   INCLUDING the ones without a whitelist server.

 - Rewritten the order that Pwordcrack does it's checks so that the terminal returns at the correct time,
   instead of too early.

 - Added Server-Side End-Game Screens - That's right... the game *actually* ends too now!
   - Also updated client-side to show end-game screens too

 - *Hopefully* fixed the bug where game was pretty much restarting upon refreshing the page...
   hopefully it won't also break reloading the page completely... will be to see

 - Added automatic joining to the join game screen, makes it easier for those who are hosting and joining
    the same game as it will automatically take the code from the Host Game you have open and attempt to join.
